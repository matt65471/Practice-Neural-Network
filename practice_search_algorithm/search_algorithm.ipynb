    "This heuristic function was choosen since it is simple while also also being admissible and consistant. The reason why it is admissible is because h(n) <= h*(n) where h(n) is our heuristic function and h*(n) is the true value. This is because in our heuristic function we always assume that we only need to change 1 letter at a time to get the correct value. As a result, we always will have a value less than the true value. This means that our A* algorithm will be curious and search all possibilities and get one closest to the true value. The reason why it is consistant is because h(n) <= cost(n, n') + h(n'). This is because the cost will always be 1 and the max that you could possibly change from h(n) to h(n') is 1. To make it simplier, we can represent it as h(n) - h(n') <= cost(n, n') where the max that h(n) - h(n') can be is 1 as you can only change 1 lettter at a time. \n",
